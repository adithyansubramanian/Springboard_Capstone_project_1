# Springboard_Capstone_project_1

This is a repository for my first capstone project completed for Springboard's Data Science career track. Here, I analyze health outcomes within the City of Chicago and how businesses in neighborhoods affect these health outcomes. 

## Getting started

### Prerequisities 
Your system must have python with the following libraries installed: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, geopandas, shapely, scikit-learn, and scipy. 

### Installing
To start please download all csv and json files in the repository. These are the datasets used for the project. Next download and run the "cleaning" notrebook. Then, download and run the visualizations notebook. Finally run the machine learning notebook. The notebooks must be run in this order, as the work in the proceeding notebooks forms the basis of the next notebook.
